# Small Scripts

A collection of various scripts I've written for various small tasks. No Git stuff here.

Don't expect them to be good, consistent, or well-documented, but you may find a few of them useful.

Dependencies: I can't remember them all, but you'll need at least these:
* PHP 5
* Ghostscript
* Bash, csh and zsh (I'm not very consistent when it comes to shells)
* xinput
* 7-Zip
