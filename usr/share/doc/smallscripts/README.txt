A collection of various scripts I've written for various small tasks.

Don't expect them to be good, consistent, or well-documented, but you may find a few of them useful.

Run make to make a .deb package you can install.

Dependencies: I can't remember them all, but you'll need at least these:
* PHP 5
* Ghostscript
* Bash, csh, and dash
