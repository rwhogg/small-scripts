A collection of various scripts I've written for various small tasks.

Don't expect them to be good, consistent, or well-documented, but you may find a few of them useful.

I would recommend using GNU stow to just copy them all into your private bin folder.

Dependencies: I can't remember them all, but you'll need at least these:
* PHP 5
* Ghostscript
* Bash, csh, and dash (sooner or later I'll try and get rid of dash, but for now please bear with me)
